# Three Golden Rectangles

This project is to demonstrate the astounding geometry of three intersecting golden rectangles and an inscribed regular icosahedron.

## Golden Rectangles

Golden rectangles are rectangles such that the ratio of length to width is 1 to *phi*, where *phi* is approximately 1.618033988749895, otherwise known as the Golden Ratio, the Golden Mean, or the Golden Section.

## Regular Icosahedron

A regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids or polyhedra, consisting of 20 regular equilateral triangles.

## Credits

This project was intended as an example to teach myself [`Three.js`](https://threejs.org/) and [`react-three-fiber`](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). I also used [`math.js`](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions/sqrt.html) for some constants and functions. The app was bootstrapped with [`Create React App`](https://create-react-app.dev/). I also incorporated some code from [@FyreStar](https://github.com/Fyrestar) for the [`InfiniteGridHelper`](https://github.com/Fyrestar/THREE.InfiniteGridHelper) and [CodeWorkshop.dev](https://codeworkshop.dev/blog/2020-04-03-adding-orbit-controls-to-react-three-fiber/) for porting `OrbitControls` to `React Three Fiber`.

Many thanks to my dad, the educator [Richard Allen Fischer](http://richardallenfischer.com/), for showing me these cool constructions when I was a kid, and taking me to the fabled [Geometry and the Imagination](https://lamington.wordpress.com/about/) course at Princeton University taught by Bill Thurston, John Conway, and Peter Doyle back in the 80's. The idea of inscribing an icosahedron on three intersecting golden rectangles appears to have originated in 15th Century Italy by [Luca Pacioli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divina_proportione), who may have in fact stolen it from [Piero della Francesca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_della_Francesca)
