# Three Golden Rectangles

This project is to demonstrate the astounding geometry of three intersecting golden rectangles and an inscribed regular icosahedron.

## Golden Rectangles

Golden rectangles are rectangles such that the ratio of length to width is 1 to *phi*, where *phi* is approximately 1.618033988749895, otherwise known as the Golden Ratio, the Golden Mean, or the Golden Section.

## Regular Icosahedron

A regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids or polyhedra, consisting of 20 regular equilateral triangles.

## Tech stack

This project was intended as an example to teach myself `Three.js` and `react-three-fiber`. I also used `math.js` for some constants and functions.
